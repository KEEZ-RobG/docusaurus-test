# Validator Guide

The LUKSO blockchain offers a rare opportunity: participation in the launch of a highly decentralized blockchain, a sister to Ethereum 2.0 nonetheless!

To participate in a proof-of-stake blockchain, you must run a node and validator software on your own hardware or a cloud platform. 

This guide will walk you through every step of the process and provide some education along the way. It is for everyone, but created especially for people who are not highly technical. 

## Start Now
Running up a validator node is a highly technical task and a long term commitment. It's a responsibility to your investment and to the network. The network's **security and stability** depends on properly maintained nodes and validator software running 24/7.

L16 test net is live. If you are planning to run a validator for mainnet, start practicing ASAP!
