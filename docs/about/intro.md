## Before you begin
Running up a validator node is a highly technical task and a long term commitment. It's a responsibility to your investment and to the network. The network's **security and stability** depends on properly maintained nodes and validator software running 24/7. You will need to:
- Monitor you node continuously
- Be prepared to update your node whenever new client software is released
- Be ready to learn
